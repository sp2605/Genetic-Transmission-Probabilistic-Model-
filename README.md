 Project Title: Prediction of the Probabilities of the Transmission of Genetic Traits within
Bayesian Logical Inference
1 Introduction
1.1 Background
 Have you ever noticed that some of us might resemble our parents in some way? Like we might have
matching eye colour, or similar hair textures etc. We got these characteristics from our parents, and
they got them from their parents. So eventually we can say that these biological informations are
passed from one generation to another. These units of inheritance are known as traits. Here we aim
to predict the traits in future generations provided the data of past generations. By some probabilistic
modelling we can predict the probability of transmission of genetic traits.
 There are many models designed to study the phenotypic prediction of traits at individual levels such as
eye color [1], height [2] ,hair color, skin color [3] etc. Prediction of traits is used for many purposes like
quantifying the risks of diseases for individuals [4] [5] [6] [7] . Diseases can be of dierent types. Among
which one in autosomal recessive disease. Such diseases are transmitted when an infected recessive gene
is crossed with another infected recessive gene . When a mutated gene from both parents is passed to
their child then their child is said to be aected. We can model dierent and complex scenarios using
appropriate probabilistic models to nd the required likelihoods and estimate the risks accordingly [8].
Second paragraph includes the general related work (must include 10-15 related references e.g [3])
 Prediction of an autosomal recessive disease named Cystic Fibrosis(CF) [9] is demonstrated in our
base article. Cystic Fibrosis(CF) is a single-gene disorder caused by mutations in CF transmembrane
conductance regulator (CFTR) genes found in cells that line the lungs, digestive tract, sweat glands, and
genitourinary system. CF patients are expected to die within the rst years of life. Their life expectancy
has lengthened with advances in diagnosis and treatment and is currently about 38 years [10].
